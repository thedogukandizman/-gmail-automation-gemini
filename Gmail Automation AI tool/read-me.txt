Project Name:
Gmail Automation with AI Agent (n8n + Google Gemini)


Created With:

n8n (Automation Tool)

Google Gemini Chat Model (via Google Cloud API)

Gmail API

Figma (for planning and flow design)

Overview
This project demonstrates a simple AI-powered automation flow built with n8n. 
The system listens for a chat message, uses Google Gemini AI to generate a professional email response, and sends the email.

It simulates a smart email assistant that could be expanded into customer support, inbox management, or a personal productivity tool.

Features
Receives incoming chat messages

Uses Gemini to generate natural language responses

Sends generated messages via Gmail

Maintains short-term memory for context

Fully automated through n8n workflow

📌 Workflow Steps
Trigger: When a chat message is received

AI Agent: Sends input to Gemini model

Model Selection: Uses Gemini Chat Model V2

Memory: Keeps simple memory context (for now)

Send Email: Outputs the Gemini response through Gmail API

📊 Visual Plan
The design was planned in Figma, including:

Gmail automation blocks

Key components (AI Agent, Pick Model, Add Gmail, Testing)

💡 Future Improvements
Add filtering and classification of incoming messages

Use long-term memory or vector DB for multi-turn threads

Create a public-facing web interface

Deploy as a lightweight personal assistant
